1) The PAGE consists of a GAME, a UI, and a RENDERER, all sending messages between each other.
2) From outside, the GAME can be queried for
    - possible moves at a given location
    - whether the game is ongoing
    and can be 
    - asked to update the gamestate.
3) The UI is in charge of 
    - constructing relevant HTML elements
    - adding relevant event listeners, which send requests for action to the PAGE.
4) The RENDERER recieves
    - gamestate data, so that it can draw the board, and
    - some UI data (Ex: the player currently has a piece selected, so we should highlight possible moves.)
    and can
    - be requested to change the current style / rendering component.
